          <p>Juiz de Fora (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈʒwiʒ dʒi ˈfɔɾɐ], Outsider Judge), also known as J.F., is a city in the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the state border with Rio de Janeiro. According to 2017 estimates the current population is about 563,769 inhabitants. <code>The geographical area of the municipality is 1,437 km2 (555 sq mi).</code></p>
        <p>The city's location was a key factor in its economic and demographic development since it is situated between the three most important financial and economic metropolises of southeast Brazil (and also the three largest urban sprawls of the country): Rio de Janeiro (189 km (117 mi)), Belo Horizonte (260 km (160 mi)) and São Paulo (486 km (302 mi)).</p>
        <p>Major highways connect Juiz de Fora with these three metropolitan areas, the most important being the BR 040 which connects Brasília with Rio de Janeiro via Belo Horizonte. The city is built on the Paraibuna, a major tributary of the Paraíba do Sul river.</p>

        <header>What is Visual Kei?</header>
        <article>
          <p>Visual kei is a movement among Japanese musicians that is characterized by the use of varying levels of make-up, elaborate hair styles and flamboyant costumes, often, but not always, coupled with androgynous aesthetics, similar to Western glam rock. <code>(Japanese: ヴィジュアル系 Hepburn: Vijuaru Kei, lit. "Visual Style" or "Visual System")</code></p>
          <p>Some Western sources consider visual kei a music genre, with its sound usually related to glam rock, punk rock and heavy metal.However, visual kei acts play various genres,including those considered by some as unrelated to rock such as electronic, pop, etc.Other sources, including members of the movement themselves, state that it is not a music genre and that the <code>freedom of expression </code> fashion and participation in the related subculture is what exemplifies the use of the term.</p>
          <p>Visual kei emerged in the 1980s underground scene,[6] pioneered by bands such as X Japan, Dead End, Buck-Tick, D'erlanger, and Color. The movement designated a new form of Japanese rock music influenced by Western hard rock and glam rock-metal acts like David Bowie, Kiss, Twisted Sister, Hanoi Rocks, Mötley Crüe, as well as punk-gothic rock and was established in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In The George Mason Review, Megan Pfeifle described the movement as being roughly divided into two generations, with the first in three transitional eras,of which the first lasted just over a decade.</p>

        <p><code>日本のヴィジュアル系はどうやって「ジュイス・デ・フォーラ」という町に住んでいたブラジルの青年男女の人生を変えましたでしょうか ?</code></p>
        <p>How has visual kei changed the lives of young Brazilians in the city of Juiz de Fora?

That’s what the short documentary titled “J-FORA KEI” (J-フォーラ系) is all about. Directed by Leo Amon, Script/Research by Marcos Vinícius and Graphic Art by Gabriel Patrocínio, the production tells the story of Brazilian young adults who decided to start bands and to write songs in the Japanese language, therefore developing a very uncommon and interesting local music scene totally inspired by the Visual Kei and J-Rock in the city of Juiz de Fora. The documentary had its premiere on October 27 at the “Primeiro Plano” Film Festival (2017) and it´s already in the process of translation. As soon as possible it’s gonna be available on Youtube in English,Japanese and Spanish subtitles.</p>

<p>p.s: There will also be a Documentary Soundtrack digital album for FREE DOWNLOAD.</p>
